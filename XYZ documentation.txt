This document shows the functionalities of the program. 

This program has the following functions

1) Homing
2) Scan Sequence
3) Snapshot
4) Change Starting Location
5) Move Z Up/Down
6) Halt

**********
* Homing *
**********
- Upon active, both the X-axis' and the Y-axis will move towards its default positiob, which is the side opposide to the respective motor. 

- While moving towards HOME, other functions will be disabled 

- When it is at HOME position, HOME button will be disabled 

- Should be disabled when another sequence/instruction is active. 

*****************
* Scan Sequence *
*****************
- Take 2 values of X, Y (length, width) as input for area to cover, the gantry system will traverse in zig-zag-like sequence until the specified area/size is covered.

- With every move, the scanner will scan the "tile", and once the sequence is complete, the scanned data will be stored as CSV file into default location. 

- At anytime during the sequence, if Halt is pressed, the entire sequence will stop. 

- Should be disabled when another sequence/instruction is active. 

************
* Snapshot *
************
- One single scan operation at current location. 

****************************
* Change Starting Location *
****************************
- Takes 2 input values of X, Y, and then move the scanner to the specified position.

- At anytime during the operation, if Halt is pressed, it will stop the operation.

- Should be disabled when another sequence/instruction is active. 

******************
* Move Z Up/Down *
